# Magnetar

The driving idea behind Magnetar is a similar one to the original [Aurora4x](https://aurora2.pentarch.org/), creating
a detailed, interesting hard(in the style sense) sci-fi grand strategy game.

However with some key differences:
- Modularity and Modability First
- Fully Open Source
- (Hopefully) Better User Experience and Modular UI
- (Hopefully) More In-Depth Economic and Political Simulation
- (Hopefully) Significantly Better Performance
